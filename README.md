🛰 Mocha_Core

Classification: Portfolio · Home Lab Dashboard · ISS Telemetry System · AI-Integrated Platform

📌 Overview

Mocha_Core is a production-grade web platform that serves as both a professional portfolio and a live telemetry dashboard for my home lab infrastructure.

This project is designed to bridge modern web deployment with bare-metal systems administration, demonstrating real-world skills in:
backend service orchestration
data pipelines
infrastructure automation
and live visualization of physical systems
It is not a static website — it is an operational node.

⚙️ Core Engine

Framework: Next.js 15 (Turbopack)
Runtime: Node.js (Production)
Role: Frontend + visualization layer
Function: Consumes live telemetry from internal services and APIs
The frontend performs no heavy computation, it visualizes data generated by backend systems, following proper separation of concerns.

🛰 ISS Telemetry System
This platform includes a live ISS ground-tracking subsystem built from first principles.

Data Flow
TLE Source → SGP4 Propagation → Telemetry Database → API → Live Map UI

Components:
TLE Ingestion: Periodic fetch from public orbital data sources
Propagation Engine: SGP4 orbital model
Storage: SQLite time-series telemetry
API: Python (Flask) service exposing structured JSON
Visualization: Leaflet-based map with live status, heading, and trail
The ISS tracker demonstrates:
physics-based data processing
continuous background services
clean backend/frontend separation
real-time visualization of non-web systems

🧠 Integrated Intelligence (AI)

The system integrates local AI inference to demonstrate on-prem compute capability and model deployment.
Model: DeepSeek-R1
Hardware: NVIDIA RTX A2000 (6GB)
Execution: Local inference (no cloud dependency)
Purpose: Real-time data processing and AI-assisted workflows
This component exists to show compute ownership, not API consumption.

🌐 Network Awareness & Security

The dashboard also acts as a frontend into my network security stack.
Features:
Live Pi-hole telemetry
DNS query statistics
Ad and tracker blocking metrics
Network health visibility
Edge Security
pfSense firewall
Cloudflare Tunnels (no exposed ports)
Hardened ingress via Nginx reverse proxy

🏗 Infrastructure Stack

Despite appearing as a simple “website,” the platform is deployed as a containerized service within a high-availability lab environment.
Hypervisor: Proxmox VE Cluster (2-node)
Containers: Debian 12 LXC
Process Supervision: systemd-managed services
Reverse Proxy: Nginx
Uptime Target: 99.9%
All backend services (telemetry ingestion, propagation, API) run as independent supervised processes, not cron jobs or ad-hoc scripts.

🚀 Deployment & Local Development

If you want to run this project locally:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Its-Mocha/Mocha_Core`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Note: Live telemetry features require the backend services to be running.
